# Ch.12-MySQL-TeamData 


## Description
This is a project designed to introduce the student to mySQL. The goal of the project was to create a database with a set of data. Then with the use of express, make a connection to that database. We then used inquirer to prompt questions in the terminal and with the responses we either manipulated the or called the data in the database.
